Art by Trey Miller and Rowan Miller, except there may be some libGDX stock graphics, and there is a font called Dickensian Christmas by Anthony Robinson I found on the internets. Also the cookies were made by various family members of mine.

Music and sounds were created by a small lump of green putty I found in my armpit one midsummer morning[.](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Ode_to_a_Small_Lump_of_Green_Putty_I_Found_in_My_Armpit_One_Midsummer_Morning)
