# holiday-cookies
a platformer game for the holidays written in libgdx. You can play it at http://broken-e.com/holiday-cookies

Code licensed under Apache 2.0 or equivalent (i.e. use however you want with no restrictions except that you think of me when you do)

Art by Trey Miller and Rowan Miller, except there may be some libGDX stock graphics, and there is a font called Dickensian Christmas by Anthony Robinson I found on the internets. Also the cookies were made by various family members of mine.

Music and sounds were created by a small lump of green putty I found in my armpit one midsummer morning.
